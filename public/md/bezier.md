The nickname started at work. She was an artist in a world of engineers, a designer who could see the curve before the math caught up. While the others wrestled with pixels like blunt instruments, she drew with precision—paths, arcs, control points placed just so. Someone called her "Bézier" once, half a joke, half admiration. It stuck.

Over time, her real name eroded like an old raster image losing resolution, smoothed away by repetition until even she couldn’t recall what it had been. HR still had it on file, but it felt like a relic, an identifier from a previous version of herself. People asked, "Wait, but what's your actual name?" She'd just shrug.

"Does it matter?" It didn’t. She was Bézier now, and Bézier was perfect.

*Character Sketch*

Bézier is the kind of person who, if the world ended tomorrow, would be standing on a pile of rubble with a hand-rolled cigarette and a well-worn pair of boots, laughing at the absurdity of it all. A little bit Tank Girl, a little bit battle-hardened survivor from The Walking Dead, she moves through life with the sharp wit of someone who has seen too much bullshit to tolerate even a single speck more.

Bézier has been a pothead for as long as anyone can remember, and it's not just a recreational habit—it’s a perspective-shifting, conspiracy-untangling, government-debunking tool. She has an artist’s imagination and an instinct for seeing past the veil of illusion that keeps the world spinning in polite denial. A graphic designer by trade, she carved her own path in an industry that evolved around her, teaching herself everything she knows, starting in the days when owning a Mac made you part of a secret underground cult. 

Her specialty is print design—a skill that, much like vinyl records and independent bookstores, is being squeezed into obscurity by the relentless march of digital progress.

She has no love for authority. In fact, she feels every bureaucratic touch like a burn on her skin. Government? A necessary evil. The healthcare industry? A scam of apocalyptic proportions. Give her five minutes and a rolling paper, and she’ll explain how the world is being gutted by capitalism while pointing out the weak spots in the system’s armour. 

And God help the plastic transport cop who tries to throw their weight around on a bus when Bézier is in the mood to dismantle them verbally.

The job hunt was bleak. She spent a year watching AI eat her industry alive, automating the craft she built a career on. Finally, she landed a gig in copy editing for an online directory—a job that’s less about creativity and more about being a functioning, detail-oriented human who can make sense of the flood of automated content. She works with a bunch of kids who don’t remember a time before the internet was all-consuming, and she finds their fresh-faced naivety amusing. The company itself is one of those bizarre modern enterprises that believes in company culture like it’s a religion; hosting periodic “gong-banging” events where everyone is expected to chant the corporate mantra. Bézier rolls her eyes but plays along, mostly for the anthropological interest.

Bézier never wanted to be a mother. It wasn’t that she hated kids; she just never saw herself in that role. She’s an auntie to two high schoolers who she loves, but parenting? Not for her. Life, in all its strangeness, led her to living with their mother, Bec, after her brother’s marriage split up. It was just a room going spare, nothing dramatic. The family setup is amicable; modern, functional, and unburdened by outdated expectations.

Meanwhile, she’s also taking care of her parents in different capacities. Her mother, Mary, is deep in the fog of dementia, living in a home where she requires full-time care. Her father, still stubbornly independent, is a charming pain in the arse. He’s the kind of old-school curmudgeon who grumbles about everything but secretly enjoys the attention.

Two feet and a heartbeat—that’s her motto. Bézier doesn’t drive. Never has. Instead, she walks. She walked the Camino de Santiago a few years back, embracing the kind of freedom that only comes when your entire world is reduced to the path in front of you. It’s an extension of her general philosophy—life is just a series of steps, so keep moving. Not driving, of course, makes her a certified “bus wanker,” but she owns it.

They met in Hervey Bay, Australia—a place so surreal it feels like a fever dream in retrospect. We spent our time around the breakfast table, getting high, drinking coffee, and discussing absolutely everything. There’s a deep, shared understanding between us: the world is broken, boring, and in desperate need of either a revolution or a proper apocalypse. The only thing worse than everything burning to the ground is everything staying exactly as it is.

Bézier has a reputation for being a little scary. Fierce, sharp, unfiltered. But under all of that, she’s got a depth that people don’t always see right away. She’s intense, but she’s also kind. A bit mental, but in the best possible way. A firebrand with a heart, a skeptic with a soul, a fighter who, despite everything, still finds joy in a well-rolled joint, a long hike, and the company of people who truly get her.
