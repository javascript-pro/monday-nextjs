As far back as I can remember I knew that if I played by the rules I'd lose. I am Wei Zang and this is my story. Some of it is true. 

I was born in a fishing village called Shenzhen in 1975. I grew up on dusty roads, surrounded by rice paddies and market stalls selling fish that were still gasping. Then, one day, the roads weren't dusty anymore. They were concrete. 

The paddies vanished under scaffolding. The markets made way for department stores. Foreigners started showing up in pressed shirts, talking about opportunities, and overnight, factories swallowed the horizon.  

By the time I was a teenager, the city wasn't just growing; it was mutating. I'd go to sleep to the sound of construction and wake up to find a new skyline. The pace was absurd. 

Someone's uncle would be repairing bicycles one week, running a factory the next. People made fortunes before they knew how to spend them. People lost everything before they knew it was gone.  

By the 90’s, Shenzhen was a neon-lit hallucination. Everything moved fast; money, deals, people. No one asked where you came from, only what you were building. It was chaos, but it was my kind of chaos. I understood it.  

By my thirties, the city had evolved again. The factories still hummed, but now they were making drones and smartphones instead of cheap radios. 

The guys who had been smuggling cassette players across the border in the '80s were now tech CEOs. If you couldn't keep up, you got left behind. Simple as that.  

Rules? Rules were suggestions. One day something was illegal, the next, it was encouraged; just depended on who was making money from it. 

Growth wasn't just an ambition; it was the only option. Everything got bigger, faster. You either moved or got buried under the next wave.  

Then I left and moved to a normal place. A city where people still lived in the same buildings their grandparents did, where laws took years to change, where you needed fifteen signatures to build a shed. And I didn't get it. Why cling to the past when you could just make something better? Why did people talk about heritage like it was a good thing?  

I watched them argue about infrastructure projects that would take five years. Five years. In Shenzhen, we built entire districts in that time.  

They talked about innovation, but everything felt slow, old. I'd check the news and see Shenzhen had just built another tech hub the size of a small country. Meanwhile, here, they were still discussing where to put a bike lane.  

Then there was their attitude to the the future. They trusted it. Assumed tomorrow would look like today. But I knew better. I had seen entire streets, entire industries, entire lives disappear overnight. Nothing is permanent. Not really.  

Shenzhen taught me that. Some things you just don’t un-learn

Back in the 90s, computer science degrees weren’t really a thing. Not the way they are now. The internet barely existed outside of universities, and even if you could get online, it was mostly a few ugly pages with blinking text and under-construction GIFs. There was no Stack Overflow, no GitHub, no endless feed of junior devs confidently posting bad advice on LinkedIn. So, I studied psychology.

I picked it because it sounded interesting, and I was bored of the Shùxué (数学), Wùlǐ (物理), Huàxué (化学) I studied at High School. 

At first, Psychology felt like the science of stating the obvious. People get stressed before exams? No shit. Then I discovered cognitive biases, and that changed everything. I started seeing them everywhere. How people deceive themselves, how they overestimate their abilities, how they confidently get things wrong. And later, in software engineering, I saw it play out in real-time.

Which brings me to the Loud Novice Problem.

Every software team has one. The junior dev who just learned how to centre a div and now has a 40-tweet thread on the best way to structure an entire SaaS platform. The guy who read half a blog post on Kubernetes and now wants to refactor everything into micro-services. The Dunning-Kruger poster child—too inexperienced to know what he doesn’t know, too confident to shut up and listen.

I worked with one recently. Fresh out of a coding bootcamp, loud on Slack, first to answer every question even when he had no idea what he was talking about. He had this relentless certainty, a kind of full-stack delusion, where he thought he was the next Jeff Dean despite struggling to write a for-loop. 

He talked his way into being lead on a new feature. Big mistake. Two months later, the code was an unreadable mess, full of unnecessary abstractions and “performance optimisations” that made everything slower. Senior devs had to quietly rewrite it all while he moved on to his next grand idea.

I don’t blame him. We all go through that phase. Some of us have the good sense to do it quietly. The real problem wasn’t him; it was the managers who mistook confidence for competence. The ones who promoted him because he "took initiative" rather than because he knew what he was doing.

That’s the thing about software. The loudest person in the room is rarely the smartest. And the smartest person? Probably too busy untangling the Loud Novice’s spaghetti code to argue.
